    "1. **Better Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks and checks for camera/file opening\n",
    "2. **Clear Comments**: Every step is explained with comments\n",
    "3. **Step-by-Step Approach**: Broken down into separate, focused examples\n",
    "4. **Print Statements**: Added informative messages to track progress\n",
    "5. **Simpler Logic**: No complex tracking algorithms, just basic detection\n",
    "6. **Easy Customization**: Clear variables at the top to change settings\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the advanced version adds:\n",
    "- **Object Tracking**: Uses DeepSORT to track objects across frames with unique IDs\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: More complex but efficient processing\n",
    "- **Advanced Features**: Persistent tracking even when objects are temporarily hidden\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Beginners: Start with These Simple Examples\n",
    "1. Run cell 8 first (image detection)\n",
    "2. Then try cell 9 (webcam detection) \n",
    "3. Move to cell 10 (object counting)\n",
    "4. Finally try cell 11 (video processing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each example builds on the previous one but remains simple and easy to understand!"
